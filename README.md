# Phasing Polystichum talamancanum

This repository contains MSA data and analysis code used to to identify the unknown progenitor of P. talamancanum through variant phasing of target-capture data, as described in:

**Phasing of Target-Capture Sequence Data Reveals the Andean Progenitor of the Central American Endemic Allotetraploid _Polystichum talamancanum_ (Dryopteridaceae)**
Julia E. McClafferty, Weston L. Testo, GoFlag Consortium, and David S. Barrington

Please contact julia.mcclafferty@univie.ac.at with any questions or requests for further information.

Raw sequence data are publicly available in the NCBI SRA under BioProject **PRJNA1255750**.

Within this repo, youâ€™ll find:
* Voucher details for the samples in this study
* Assembled sequences, including both target-only regions and target-plus-flanking regions (supercontigs) generated using GoFlag reference and HybPiper. Phased sequences for_ P. talamancanum _from the HybPhaser workflow assembled with GoFlag reference and HybPiper. 
* Multiple sequence alignments for both target-only and target-plus-flanking regions (supercontigs), generated with GoFlag references and HybPiper. A multiple sequence alignment created from Hybphaser's loci consensus sequences containing the phased accessions of _P. talamancanum_ used to generate trees downstream.
* Gene trees derived from alignments with phased accessions
* Species trees inferred through supermatrix and multispecies coalescent approaches
