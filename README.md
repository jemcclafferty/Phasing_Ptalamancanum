# Phasing Polystichum talamancanum

This repository contains MSA data and analysis code used to to identify the unknown progenitor of P. talamancanum through variant phasing of target-capture data, as described in:

  Phasing of Target-Capture Sequence Data Reveals the Andean Progenitor of the Central American Endemic Allotetraploid _Polystichum talamancanum_ (Dryopteridaceae)**
  Julia E. McClafferty, Weston L. Testo, GoFlag Consortium, and David S. Barrington

Please contact julia.mcclafferty@univie.ac.at with any questions or requests for further information.

Raw sequence data are publicly available in the NCBI SRA under BioProject **PRJNA1255750**.

Within the Data folder, you’ll find:
* Voucher details for the samples in this study  
* Multiple sequence alignments for both target-only and target-plus-flanking regions, generated with GoFlag references, HybPiper, and HybPhaser 
* Gene trees derived from these alignments 
* Species trees inferred through concatenated and multispecies coalescent approaches
